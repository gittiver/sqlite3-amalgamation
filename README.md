# sqlite3-amalgamation
this repository contains a cmake based build of sqlite (and its tools) based on source download from sqlite.org

## TODO
- [ ] integrate build of sqldiff
- [ ] make cleaner build by splitting static and dynamic library build into separate builds (based on ideas of alex reinking)
